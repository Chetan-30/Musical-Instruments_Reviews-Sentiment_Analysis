Problems addressed in this notebook are as follows :-


Problem Statement 1 :- Pre-rate the review on their 'helpfulness' factor.
          The problem is the poor quality of Amazon reviews at the top of the forum despite the “helpfulness” rating system. The problem is that new reviews to be placed at the top 
          of the forum, for a chance to be rated by the community. The proposed solution to this problem is to use machine learning techniques to design a system that “pre-rates”
          new reviews on their “helpfulness” before they are given a position at the top of the forum. This way, poor quality reviews will be more unlikely to be shown at the top
          of the forum, as they do not get the “freepass” because they are new. The proposed system will use a set of Amazon review data to train itself to predict a helpfulness 
          classification (helpful, or not helpful) for new input data.

Problem Statement 2 :- To test Genuinity of 'reviewText' vs 'Score'
          Have you ever met in your listing that there are 1 star reviews left by non-verified purchase “buyers” with very positive comment or vice-versa with 5 star reviews with a 
          negative comment.
